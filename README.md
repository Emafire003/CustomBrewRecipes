# CustomBrewRecipes
A fabric mod that allows developers to create new Brewing Recipes that also support custom non potion items and NBT data. 

Detailed instructions can be found in the javadoc, but all you have to do is calling "CustomBrewRecipeRegister.registerCustomRecipe" and supply the items for the recipe.
